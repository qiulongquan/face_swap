# Handpose-WonderSeen-Net

1. DATABASE: RHD_published_v2.
2. DATABASE INFO: RGBD, four channels, pix-level label.
3. CODE: To be updated in 2 months.
4. ADDITION: This script isn't the final version of my work of gesture recognization. For that Code Management requires a lot of work, the script 'Wonderseen_HandPose_cnn_depth.py' is provided merely as reference to show the main thoughts of the process.
